The characteristics of these paintings change as children grow, and children’s expressiveness\\nin the paintings also improves. Children’s paintings are a representation of their perceptions of\\nthings; children transform their perceptions into images that can be understood and observed by\\npeople. This research studies the growth characteristics of children based on professional painting\\ntechniques. A digital image analysis method was used to analyze the painting techniques of children\\naged between 7 and 13. The growth characteristics of the di ﬀerent age groups were combined to\\nanalyze the representative characteristics of children’s paintings at di ﬀerent ages. Lastly, the results of\\npart of a questionnaire survey were used to assist in studying these characteristics. Analysis of these\\npaintings shows that children have a poor ability to control the scale of the objects. Furthermore,\\nthe details of the objects are ignored, and children have a poor imitation ability. Young children have\\nlower spatial cognitive abilities than older children, and girls prefer to participate in painting more\\nthan boys.\\nKeywords: children’s growth concern; children’s painting learning; children’s painting features;\\ndigital image analysis\\n1. Introduction\\nPaintings are endowed with individual creative ideas by children. Painting is one of the ways to\\nrepresent people’s imagination [ 1] (pp. 11–29); in other words, people like to record their imaginary\\nand observed scenes in paintings. Moreover, paintings are the sum of people’s perceptions of\\nobjects (such as the perceptions of the appearance of the shape, volume, and color of the object).\\nAccording to the content of children’s paintings, teachers can learn about their living environment [ 2,3].\\nChildren’s paintings contain features of the described objects and indicate the children’s observation\\nability [ 4]. Children will record what they see (such as life scenes, activity scenes, and natural scenes)\\nin paintings, and their observation ability can also be shown in the details of the paintings (such as\\ndepictions of the decorative patterns of objects, facial expressions of characters, and ﬁgural postures).\\nThe positional, distance, and proportional relationships of di ﬀerent objects in paintings show the\\nimpact of events or people on children [ 5]. The content of children’s paintings is derived from their life\\nand painting experiences [ 6]. There is an existential communication among color, taste, touch, smell,\\nsound, and weight in artwork, which constitutes its overall content [7]. The same intrinsic link exists\\nin the main components of paintings: There is a connection between color, content, composition, and\\nlines in paintings, and the content and structure of the painting determine its quality. When guiding\\nchildren to create paintings, ﬁne art teachers should fully understand the content of children’s paintings\\n(such as color distribution, the layout of the lines, and shapes of objects in paintings) and accurately\\nHealthcare 2020 ,8, 109; doi:10.3390 /healthcare8020109 www.mdpi.com /journal /healthcare', metadata={'source': 'test_folder/healthcare-08-00109.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Therefore, analyzing the content of children’s paintings helps ﬁne art teachers to\\nguide children more e ﬀectively to create them.\\nIn the past, research on children’s paintings relied on the human visual system to judge them.\\nThis kind of painting evaluation method is a ﬀected by personal emotions, cultural background,\\nliving environment, and preferences, and is also inﬂuenced by personal subjective evaluation standards.\\nHowever, using digital image analysis methods can reduce experimental error caused by personal\\nsubjective evaluation, as the results obtained from such methods are more objective. Paintings can be\\nevaluated from extracted image features from the perspective of local and global features to determine\\nvisual quality [ 8,9]. This method can help people to simply assess the visual quality of paintings.\\nAssessment (including, e.g., lines, color features, and composition features) involves dividing the\\nimage according to di ﬀerent details and then using a digital image analysis method to evaluate\\nsaid details [ 10]. In this study, children’s paintings are converted into digital images, and an image\\nbinarization method is used to analyze the images. The analysis process of image binarization selects\\nthe best threshold in the image by using the Otsu algorithm, and then retains the image’s texture\\nfeatures required for research purposes [ 11,12], [13] (pp. 445–448). Each color in a digital image has\\na corresponding pixel value; the image binarization method sets the gray value of pixels in the image\\nto 0 or 255 [ 14]. Using a digital image analysis method to analyze children’s paintings can help art\\nteachers to analyze them more accurately and thus to e ﬀectively reduce experimental error.\\nPainting technique training is necessary for children’s painting education [ 15]. For example,\\ntraining in the use of painting tools can help children create di ﬀerent styles of paintings, and imitation\\ntraining can help children understand the process and method of painting creation. Learning the rules\\nof painting composition can help children improve the visual e ﬀects of their paintings. In the process\\nof painting practice for children who have not received professional drawing training, due to the\\nlack of clear painting training goals and evaluation standards, the drawing ability of children cannot\\nbe improved [ 16] (pp. 47–65). This also highlights problems (such as composition and modeling\\nproblems) when applying painting techniques in the paintings of children who have not received\\nprofessional painting training. Therefore, this study evaluates the paintings of children who are not\\ntrained and then discusses existing problems while children create paintings.\\nThe content of a painting determines its quality, and composition, lines, colors, and shapes\\nrepresent this quality [ 17]. Content analysis can help teachers to determine the features of high-quality\\npaintings; in terms of children’s paintings, the basic characteristics include consistency of tones,\\nrelevant content, and a sense of space [ 18]. These factors can also assist the learner in improving\\npainting ability. In addition, studying the common characteristics of children’s paintings can help\\nﬁne art teachers better understand and observe children’s painting habits, such as painting styles,\\nmaterial use, and creative habits. In the process of guiding children to paint, ﬁne art teachers need\\nto consider children’s learning and development. After fully understanding their painting habits,\\nthey can then make teaching plans according to the characteristics of children’s paintings. This can\\nalso help ﬁne art teachers to acquire knowledge points that children cannot grasp in the process of\\nlearning how to paint.\\nChildren of di ﬀerent ages have di ﬀerent abilities in terms of painting expression, cognition of', metadata={'source': 'test_folder/healthcare-08-00109.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

The process by which children learn to create paintings is also a process that helps children\\nunderstand and experience beauty. Painting creation can cultivate children’s sense of innovation,\\nesthetic judgment, and ability to evaluate beauty. Fine art education a ﬀects students’ thinking styles [ 19],\\nand helps them to improve their imagination, creativity, and observation in the process of painting [ 20].\\nFine art education also a ﬀects students’ observation ability [ 21]; for example, after children learn about\\nperspective, they have the cognitive ability of space. When students have learned basic painting\\ntechniques, they start to pay attention to the details of objects in their paintings—for example, the\\ndecorative patterns, proportions, distances, and positional relationships of objects. After children\\nlearn to paint, they also start to pay attention to the proportional relationships between objects in\\ntheir paintings [ 22]. In Asian nations (including China, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea,\\nand Singapore), many preschool children often ﬁnd themselves in learning environments of scripted\\nteaching, rote learning, and standardized assessment [ 23–25]. Fixed-mode education can make\\nchildren lose their sense of innovation, and rote learning can also result in a loss of interest in\\nlearning [ 26]. Therefore, changing education of ﬁxed patterns can help children increase their interest\\nin learning. Considering children’s artistic cognitive ability from the perspective of their painting\\nhabits, their drawing skills, and the application of painting techniques, Malchiodi (1998) combined\\ndiﬀerent psychological research methods to evaluate the lines, shapes, sizes, positions, and colors of\\nobjects in children’s paintings. It is important to cultivate children’s composition ability in order to\\nhelp them to arrange objects in paintings in the proper position. The purpose of teaching children\\npainting composition is to help them to establish the cognition of the positional relationship of objects\\nand perspectives, and to help them to structure paintings to well-deﬁned levels (the proportional\\nrelationship of di ﬀerent objects in paintings).\\nArt education itself has important implications for human growth and development [ 27].\\nChildren’s drawing ability is related to their cognitive ability [ 28]. Children’s paintings develop\\nfrom a simpliﬁcation to a complex representation of an object’s shape [ 29]. When younger children\\nﬁrst start painting, they are less expressive [ 5]; therefore, their paintings show simple shapes and lack\\ndetails, and most of the objects in the paintings are composed of lines. With the development of their\\ncognitive ability and continuous painting practice, children begin to use di ﬀerent painting materials to\\ncreate di ﬀerent styles of painting. The improvement of children’s drawing ability is achieved by the\\nguidance of art teachers and the study of art courses [ 30], which refers to the theory of “Discipline-Based\\nArt Education (DBAE).” The aim of DBAE is to help children to create esthetic perception paintings\\nthrough systematic ﬁne art courses. For children, painting training courses have a positive impact on\\ntheir painting abilities. The signiﬁcance of art education is not only to improve children’s ability to\\npaint, but also, and more importantly, to help children develop a sense of innovation. The cultivation\\nof children’s imagination is more important than their knowledge education, as imagination can\\npromote the progress of knowledge. Learning activities (such as learning music, handmade crafts,\\nand painting) can better help children learn in the process of acquiring knowledge, as well as build\\na link between children’s learning at school and their daily experiences [ 31].

A study about science\\neducation mentions that ﬁne arts play a decisive role in science education [ 32], and further studies\\nhave shown that images are more likely to evoke human imagination than words [ 33]. The results of\\nart education directly determine the results of the cultivation of children’s innovative consciousness.\\nIn the process of painting creation, the painting construction process also enhances children’s esthetic\\nconsciousness. In addition, researchers have proved that ﬁne arts can e ﬃciently promote the learning\\nof other scientiﬁc knowledge [34].\\nPaintings contain both things in real life and things approaching real life [ 33]. Artworks combine\\nall possible connected things within a valid range, and analyzing the content of paintings through\\nscientiﬁc analysis methods is a way of analyzing the creative process and the creative consciousness of\\nthe creators.

In the process of painting creation, di ﬀerences in things can be distinguished by changes in these\\nlines, colors, and shapes of objects. When people observe the object, image information transmitted\\nby the object is immediately combined with the subjective consciousness of human beings; this is the\\nexchanging process of image information. A painting is a superﬁcial image of the combination of the\\nhuman subjective consciousness and the information conveyed by objects. Painting creation is closely\\nconnected to people’s living environment. The process of children’s painting creation is also the process\\nby which children reproduce a scene that they observe (such as a natural scene, a life scene, or a school\\nscene) [ 35]. The role of painting education is to combine children’s observation experience with teachers’\\npainting skill guidance in order to help children better complete painting creation. Painting training\\ncan help children to consider the relationship between people and the natural environment [ 36,37].\\nChildren’s paintings reﬂect their esthetic consciousness, and ideal painting training methods can help\\nchildren to improve their drawing skills.\\nChildren’s painting researcher Viktor Lowenfeld divided the development of children’s painting\\ninto six stages: The “scribble stage” (2–4 years old), the “pre-schematic stage” (4–7 years old),\\n“schematic stage” (7–9 years old), the “dawning realism stage” (9–11 years old), the “pseudo-realism\\nstage” (11–13 years old), and the “decision stage (the adolescent period)” [ 38]. Children’s paintings\\ninvolve their imaginative, expressive, and creative abilities [ 39] (pp. 194–225), and the development of\\ntheir paintings is related to their cognitive ability [ 40]. The paintings of children of di ﬀerent ages reﬂect\\nthe development of their understanding of visual information; in particular, the content of children’s\\npaintings is related to the characteristics of their psychological development [ 36]. Thus, children’s\\npaintings need to be analyzed in combination with their painting performance at di ﬀerent ages.\\nThe study of children’s painting education has predominantly focused on the composition of their\\npaintings, and psychological analysis methods have been used to study the content of these paintings.\\nAnalyzing children’s paintings is important as it can help teachers to determine any problems during\\nthe process of learning how to create paintings. The research also shows that art can help children to\\ndevelop di ﬀerent cognitive skills; for example, art can help children to develop socio-emotional and\\nmotor skills. Moreover, art has a positive impact on children’s self-expression [41].\\n3. Method\\n3.1. Content for the Research\\nThis research was conducted by utilizing questionnaires and digital image analysis. The questions\\nincluded in the questionnaire were based on painting guidelines and children’s preferences for\\npainting creation (Appendix A). The role of the questionnaire was to determine whether the children\\nparticipating in the survey met the requirements of the study, since the participants in this study were\\nchildren who had not received professional painting training. Children have a ﬁxed painting creation\\nmode after they receive painting training [ 42]. For instance, children arrange people or objects in a ﬁxed\\nposition (Question 1 in the questionnaire) or decorate paintings with ﬁxed patterns and color (Question\\n2 in the questionnaire). The training of painting skills includes imitation training (Question 3 in the\\nquestionnaire) and composition training (Question 5 and 6 in the questionnaire) [ 27]. Thus, inquiring\\nabout children’s imitation ability and their ability to control objects in paintings is helpful for further\\njudgments about whether children have received painting training or not.

Lastly, children’s composition\\nability was judged based on the calculated results.\\n3.2. Participants\\nThe participants involved in this study were children aged from 7 to 13 years old who had not\\nreceived professional painting training. A total of 416 children participated in the test—182 girls and\\n234 boys. The children were divided into three age groups according to the characteristics of their\\npainting learning (Table 1). All children were able to create paintings independently. Children who\\nhad not received professional painting training were involved in the test because some professionally\\ntrained children may have a ﬁxed style in their paintings; as such, these children unconsciously use the\\ncomposition method they have learnt when they creating paintings, and may create their own rules.\\nTherefore, including children who have received professional training in the experiment would a ﬀect\\nthe results. In contrast, paintings by children who have not received professional painting training are\\ninﬂuenced by various external factors; these type of paintings are based on their personal painting\\nhabits. Their paintings can help researchers identify the problems of painting techniques that children\\nlikely face in the creation process. Studying such children without professional painting training can\\nhelp to determine painting characteristics and habits more e ﬀectively. All of the experiments in this\\nstudy were conducted with the consent of the participant and the participant’s parents. None of the\\ntest results involve personal or private information.

Data Preparation\\nThe visual e ﬀect of a painting is best when the mathematical scale between the components in the\\npainting is close or equal to 0.618. Some studies have shown that the golden ratio ( Φ=1.618033988749\\n. . .) is a proportion that can evoke people’s sense of beauty; however, there is no related research on\\nthe value of the golden ratio [43]. Moreover, there are no research data showing that the golden ratio\\ndestroys the vision of beauty [ 44]. Therefore, the golden ratio can be considered the perfect proportion\\nto create the best visual e ﬀects in painting. Furthermore, many of the artworks with good visual e ﬀects\\nare in line with the golden ratio [ 45]. In this study, the value of the golden ratio was used to test the\\nvisual e ﬀects of children’s drawings. In research on the value of the golden ratio, it has been conﬁrmed\\nthat artworks in the interval 0.606–0.63093 had a good visual e ﬀect [ 45,46]. When judging whether\\nan object meets the golden ratio standard, the small di ﬀerence between the actual calculation vale and\\nthe value of the golden ratio is acceptable [ 43,47]. Therefore, in this study, if the proportion of the main\\nbody of the paintings is in the range of 0.606–0.63093, it was judged that the proportion of the object of\\nthe painting work is appropriately arranged.

Thus, this kind of algorithm is suitable for analyzing children’s paintings.\\nThe study process of children’s paintings was divided into three steps (Figure 1). The ﬁrst step\\nwas to convert children’s paintings in JPEG format. The resolution of all images used for analysis\\nwas 300 PPI. The second step was to judge the painting type and then to convert the paintings into\\na black and white image. The third step was to calculate the percentage of black pixels in the image\\nas a percentage of the total number of pixels. Finally, based on the result of the calculation, it was\\njudged whether the proportion of the subject in the child’s painting was appropriate. Before analyzing\\nthe proportion of subjects, the paintings needed to be pre-processed. Di ﬀerent children have di ﬀerent\\npainting habits, and due to the di ﬀerences in children’s composition methods and material usage habits,\\ndiﬀerent composition forms will appear. Furthermore, di ﬀerent texture e ﬀects produced by di ﬀerent\\npainting materials (such as colored pens, crayons, oil pastels, etc.) and painting papers would a ﬀect\\nthe study results; therefore, the painting materials used in children’s paintings were limited to colored\\npens and pencils (pencils were used for the contour lines of the objects in the paintings). The contour\\nlines drawn with pencil were ﬁne lines, and occupied only a small area of the entire painting. Therefore,\\npaintings with pencils were also accepted. The papers that the children used were all white sketch\\npaper. In order to improve the accuracy of the test, it was necessary to binarize the di ﬀerent types\\nof paintings. According to the distribution of the objects in the paintings, the paintings of children\\nwho had not received painting training were divided into four types: Paintings without a background\\ncolor, paintings with partial scene descriptions, paintings with lines only, and full compositions [ 2,48].\\nBy sorting out children’s paintings, the following characteristics were observed: (1) Paintings without\\na background color (Figures 2 and 3) lacked the depiction of an environment (such as the sky, clouds,\\nsun, and background colors) and only simple characters or objects. In transforming these paintings,\\nit was necessary to binarize the areas that represented the main content of the paintings; Figures 2 and 3\\nshow the features of this type of painting before and after image binarization.

Therefore, when this type of painting was transformed, the area deﬁned by\\nthe lines needed to be binarized. Figure 4 shows the e ﬀect of the binarization of images of this kind of\\npainting. (3) Some paintings had a colored background (Figure 5). In this type of work, the paintings\\nwere full of color. If researchers convert an unprocessed painting to a binarized image, all of the colors\\nin the painting will be binarized; thus, converting images in this way will a ﬀect the results of the\\ntest. Therefore, for this type of painting, the background color needed to be removed before image\\nbinarization.

Discussion\\n4.1. Practical Importance\\nThere are two main problems with children’s objects in paintings. First, most children who have\\nnot received professional painting training cannot control the scale of the objects; thus the proportion\\nof objects in these children’s paintings is inappropriate. This problem also a ﬀects the visual e ﬀects of\\nthe children’s drawings. This problem arises because the children lack training in observation and\\ncomposition. The training of children’s observation ability can be realized through analysis of ﬁne arts.\\nIn the process of analyzing ﬁne arts, children can understand the composition of a painting, the methods\\nof painting creation, and the spatial relationship of objects in the painting. Another problem is the\\nlack of decorative patterns in the paintings of children who have not received professional painting\\ntraining. This problem results in a lack of ornamental value in children’s paintings; decorative patterns\\nreduce the area of white space in paintings. These children’s observation abilities limit the creation\\nof their paintings, and they do not know how to express the details of objects. Thus, a large area of', metadata={'source': 'test_folder/healthcare-08-00109.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Healthcare 2020 ,8, 109 13 of 16\\nwhite space appears in many children’s paintings. Therefore, teaching about imitation of decorative\\npatterns in children’s drawing training can help children solve this problem. In training children to\\ncreate decorative patterns in paintings, teachers can instruct them to add decorative patterns with\\nsimple geometric ﬁgures to their paintings. After a child has mastered a simple decorative pattern\\ndrawing method, teachers can guide them to change the shape of this decorative pattern as way to\\nlearn new patterns. This method can also diversify the decorative pattern styles in children’s paintings.\\nAs for proportion training, teachers can guide children to draw lines to divide their painting paper into\\ndiﬀerent areas before they begin to paint. Additionally, teachers can add object observation courses to\\nhelp children better understand the features of objects.\\n4.2. Theoretical Importance\\nImitation ability is the foundation for children to learn painting. However, in terms of creative\\nbehavior, children without painting training lack the ability to imitate paintings, and they cannot\\nimitate painting work independently. Furthermore, the imitation ability of boys is lower than that of\\ngirls. The process of imitation training can help children to understand the process of painting creation,\\nto improve their ability to use painting materials, and to learn about composition. Children can learn\\nthe creation process when imitating other people’s paintings, thus the process of learning to imitate is\\nalso the process of learning painting creation. Children can also improve their ability to use di ﬀerent\\npainting materials by copying their works. Moreover, children who have not received painting training\\nhave a weak ability to create scenes of an environment in paintings. This problem is due to a lack of\\nawareness of natural environments. To solve this problem, ﬁne art teachers can lead children to sketch\\noutdoors, which can help them to better observe and understand things in the natural environment.\\n5. Conclusions\\nThe composition of a child’s painting determines its visual e ﬀects. In children’s painting practices,\\nchildren can improve the visual e ﬀects of their paintings by considering the position and proportion of\\nobjects. Painting skills training can help children to improve their observation and esthetic abilities.\\nAccording to digital image analysis, children who have not received painting training have a poor\\nability to control the scale of objects—the objects in these children’s paintings are small. Therefore,\\nwhen guiding these children to create paintings, ﬁne art teachers should pay attention to cultivating\\ntheir ability to control the size of objects. The results of the questionnaire show that children who have\\nnot received professional painting training have a poor imitation ability. Children’s painting skills\\nwill be e ﬀectively improved after receiving imitation training, thus ﬁne art teachers should deliver\\nsome imitation training. In addition, children who have not received professional training in painting\\nthink that the process of creating paintings is di ﬃcult, which is due to a lack of knowledge regarding\\npainting composition and creative methods.\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.Y.; methodology, L.Y.; formal analysis, L.Y.; investigation, L.Y.; data\\ncuration, L.Y. and Y.N.; writing—original draft preparation, L.Y.; writing—review and editing, L.Y. and Y.N.\\nAll authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\\nConﬂicts of Interest: The authors declare that there are no conﬂict of interest.\\nAppendix A\\nQuestionnaire\\n1.
